## About Me
### Introduction
I am currently a contracted Member Service Representative at Navy Federal through Tential, where I am dedicated to delivering exceptional service to our members. In my role, I assist with a range of core account services, including balance checks, money transfers, and online banking support for personal, business, and associated member accounts.

Alongside my work at Navy Federal, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Data Science from Arizona State University Online. I am seeking this degree as I want to gain insight into data science and its expections in the workforce.

I believe in striving for excellence and proficiency in every role I undertake. My goal is to ensure that both employer and member experiences are optimized through effective and diligent work. Looking ahead, I am focused on transitioning into a business analytics or data science position, where I can leverage my skills and education to establish impactful business decisions.
